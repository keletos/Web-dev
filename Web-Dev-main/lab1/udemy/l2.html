    <p>Add your headers below this paragraph element! Add an h1, h2, h3, and h4. You should see your new headers displayed in the preview pane.
    </p>
    <h1>Header1</h1>
    <h2>Header2</h2>
    <h3>Header3</h3>
    <h4>Header4</h4>
    <p>Don't forget to add some text to your headers. They won't display anything otherwise.

        Create an unordered list! Make a list of the three web languages: HTML,
        CSS and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Tree structures</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            Tree structures allow you to organize your HTML documents into
            meaningful sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is helpful for readability and to provide a consistent structure
            for styling and programmatic control with CSS and JavaScript.

        This is a big paragraph of text about Udacity. Cool. Cool. And here is an
        image!
        <img
                src="http://udacity.github.io/fend/images/udacity.png"
                alt="Udacity Logo"
        />
        Here's another question for you: how is the text reacting to the image? Is
        the image on its own line or is it showing up in the same last as the rest
        of the text?
    </p>
